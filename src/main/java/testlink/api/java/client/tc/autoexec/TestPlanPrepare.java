/**
 * An implementer of this interface is expected to do the following:
 * 
 * Required:
 * 
 * 1)  Assign the executors for all the automated test cases in the test plan.  
 * 
 * Optional:
 * 
 *  1) Add additional test cases that are not listed in the plan. Especially helpful
 *  when the list of test cases is maintained and added to using programatic means.
 *  
 *  2) Replace the test cases with different TestCase interface implementations. 
 *  A good example would be when the default ExecutableTestCase could be replaced
 *  with CustomTestCase which extends ExecutableTestCase. 
 *  
 *  3) etc..
